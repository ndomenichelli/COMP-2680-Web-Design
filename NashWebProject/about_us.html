      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>	<span>I</span> am a child at heart. Growing up I was the queen of dress up. 
			The children in the neighborhood knew on any given Saturday, they could come over to 
			our house, and get swaddled in old drapes, and come out as a king or queen.</p>
		
			<p>My sewing skills have improved with time. Originally learned on gram's Singer 
			treadle machine. All curtains turned into ball gowns. All old blankets became knights. 
			Growing up watching Carol Burnet with costume designer Bob Mackie, I was tremendously 
			inspired. The sense of humor involved became irresistable.</p>
			
			<p>I chose to design costumes, for theme parties, performances and weddings.
			I could never not know, what lied on the other side of a closed door. Basements and 
			attics are my favorite place to be. A ton of treasures in vintage clothing and reusable 
			fabrics somewhere in a trunk...</p>
